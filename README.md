# Personalized Students Recommendation Project

## Project Overview

The **Personalized Students Recommendation Project** aims to analyze and visualize quiz performance data to provide actionable insights and personalized recommendations. By leveraging current and historical quiz data, the project offers a detailed evaluation of user performance and highlights areas for improvement.

---

## Features

- Mistake rate analysis for individual quizzes.
- Visualization of trends in accuracy and scores over time.
- Comparison of performance across topics and difficulty levels.
- Generation of personalized recommendations to improve quiz outcomes.

## Data Overview

This project processes data from two sources:

### 1. **Current Quiz Data**

This dataset includes the details of a userâ€™s most recent quiz submission, covering questions, topics, and user responses. It is accessed through the following endpoints:

- **Quiz Endpoint**: [https://jsonkeeper.com/b/LLQT](https://jsonkeeper.com/b/LLQT)
- **Quiz Submission Data**: [https://api.jsonserve.com/rJvd7g](https://api.jsonserve.com/rJvd7g)

### 2. **Historical Quiz Data**

This dataset contains performance data from the last 5 quizzes taken by each user. It includes scores and a response map (Key: Question ID, Value: Selected Option ID). The data is fetched from:

- **API Endpoint**: [https://api.jsonserve.com/XgAgFJ](https://api.jsonserve.com/XgAgFJ)

## Key Functionalities

### Mistake Analysis

- Compute mistake rates for each quiz.
- Visualize mistake rates using bar charts for both current and historical data.

### Trend Analysis

- Track accuracy and score trends over time.
- Generate trend lines to identify performance patterns.

### Topic-Wise Performance

- Extract quiz topics and calculate topic-specific accuracy.
- Create bar charts to display accuracy for each topic.

### Difficulty-Level Performance

- Extract difficulty levels from quiz data.
- Compare and visualize average scores for different difficulty levels.

### Personalized Recommendations

- Highlight weak areas based on low accuracy scores.
- Identify quizzes with high mistake rates.
- Suggest strategies to improve time management and speed.
- Provide advanced-level recommendations for high-performing users.
